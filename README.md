# motivation

I always wondering crypto world so I decided to use my Financial knowledges with programming codes to aggregate the data and create this dashboard which contains a few elements. 
the first one is a homepage. 
here you can select your desire coins, you can seperate it by ",", after selecting the desire time and period then it will return the aggregating plot beside optimum porttfolio based on sharpe ratio and also optimum portfolio based on HRP method, hierarchical riks parityl, you can see the Grayscale, one of the greatest ivestors in crypto, portfolio.

FBporphet or Arima.
