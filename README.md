# Motivation

I always wondered about the crypto world, so I decided to use my Financial knowledge with programming codes to aggregate the data and create this dashboard with a few elements. the first one is a homepage. here you can select your desired coins, you can separate them by ",", after choosing the desired time, which ranges from minute to monthly, and period then it will return the aggregating plot beside the optimum portfolio based on Sharpe ratio and also the optimum portfolio based on the HRP method, hierarchical riks parity, you can see the Grayscale, one of the greatest investors in crypto, portfolio. 

## Illustration!

The above image shows the relational closing price for 300 days based on 12 hours of data points and also creates a portfolio for these coins by Sharpe ratio and HRP methods.

And also there are some methods for trading based on famous algorithm trading methods like mean reversion trading or predicting methods like 
FBporphet or Arima. 
you can also see your portfolio on Binance and kucoin and also set limits or market orders for trading.

## TODO:

Some main features will be done, for example:

In the news part, a client can get information from Twitter and telegram channels by applying sentiment analysis by Bert.
In algorithm parts, some famous methods implement in order to make more information about a chosen coin.
